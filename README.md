Description of the Code

This Python program is an interactive calculator designed for students that can perform basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to repeatedly perform calculations until they choose to exit.

Features:
Menu Display:
The program shows a menu listing the available operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Modulus (remainder)
Average
Exit

User Input:

The program asks the user to choose an operation by entering a number from 1 to 7.
For all arithmetic operations (1–6), it prompts the user to enter two numbers, allowing both integers and decimals.

Operations Performed:

Addition: Adds the two numbers and displays the result.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first and displays the result.
Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers and displays the result.
Division: Divides the first number by the second and displays the result. Includes a check to prevent division by zero.
Modulus: Calculates the remainder of dividing the first number by the second and displays it.
Average: Calculates the correct average of the two numbers using (num1 + num2) / 2 and displays it.
Exit Option:

If the user enters 7, the program prints a goodbye message and terminates the loop.
If the user enters an invalid choice (other than 1–7), the program prints an error message and prompts again.
Continuous Operation:

The program runs in a loop, allowing multiple calculations without restarting.

After each operation, it returns to the main menu, making it user-friendly for students.
